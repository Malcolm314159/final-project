# final-project
This repo contains my final project for SIBos Ruby Part Time May 2016

Loading folder-sizer1.rb gives you the methods:

directory_contents(path)
directory_subdirectories(path)
directory_size(path)
  
the two .txt files are examples of dropbox folder metadata.
Each file contains the metadata for a single dropbox folder on
my dropbox account.  As you can see, the metadata for a
folder is a hash of basic info. One entry is an array
of hashs with metadata for the contents of the folder.
